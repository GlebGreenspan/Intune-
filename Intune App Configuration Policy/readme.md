Intune App Configuration Policy script samples
This repository of PowerShell sample scripts show how to retrieve, create, delete, and modify Intune service resources using cmdlets from the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK.

Documentation for Intune and Microsoft Graph can be found here https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/beta/resources/intune_graph_overview.

Disclaimer
Some script samples retrieve information from your Intune tenant, and others create, delete or update data in your Intune tenant. Understand the impact of each sample script prior to running it; samples should be run using a non-production or "test" tenant account.

Within this section there are the following scripts with the explanation of usage.

1. AppConfigurationPolicy_Export.ps1
This script gets all App Configuration policies (for both Managed Device + Managed App policy types) from the Intune Service that you have authenticated with. The script will then export the policies to .json format in the directory of your choice.

For Managed Device app config types, the example uses the Get-MgDeviceAppManagementMobileAppConfiguration cmdlet and manipulates property names/structure of the returned data into a more consumable JSON format for later imports.

For Managed App app config types, the example uses the Invoke-MGraphRequest cmdlet and does not modify returned data other than converting it to JSON format.

2. ManagedAppPolicy_Import_FromJSON.ps1
This script imports and creates an App Configuration Policy into the Intune Service that you have authenticated with from a specified JSON file.

When you run the script it will prompt for a path to a .json file, if the path and JSON are valid the import will be attempted.

$ImportPath = Read-Host -Prompt "Please specify a path to a JSON file to import data from e.g. C:\IntuneOutput\Policies\policy.json"

# Replacing quotes for Test-Path
$ImportPath = $ImportPath.replace('"','')

if(!(Test-Path "$ImportPath")){

Write-Host "Import Path for JSON file doesn't exist..." -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "Script can't continue..." -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host
break

}
