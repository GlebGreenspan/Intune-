Disclaimer
Some script samples retrieve information from your Intune tenant, and others create, delete or update data in your Intune tenant. Understand the impact of each sample script prior to running it; samples should be run using a non-production or "test" tenant account.

Within this section there are the following scripts with the explanation of usage.

1. CompliancePolicy_Get.ps1
This script gets all the Compliance policies from the Intune Service that you have authenticated with.

2. CompliancePolicy_Export.ps1
This script gets all Compliance policies (for all platforms) from the Intune Service that you have authenticated with. The script will then export the policies to .json format in the directory of your choice.

For retrieving the policies the example uses the Get-MgDeviceManagementDeviceCompliancePolicy cmdlet and manipulates property names/structure of the returned data into a more consumable JSON format for later imports.

3. CompliancePolicy_Import_FromJSON.ps1
This script imports and creates an Compliance Policy into the Intune Service that you have authenticated with from a specified JSON file.

When you run the script it will prompt for a path to a .json file, if the path and JSON are valid the import will be attempted.

$ImportPath = Read-Host -Prompt "Please specify a path to a JSON file to import data from e.g. C:\IntuneOutput\Policies\policy.json"

# Replacing quotes for Test-Path
$ImportPath = $ImportPath.replace('"','')

if(!(Test-Path "$ImportPath")){

Write-Host "Import Path for JSON file doesn't exist..." -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "Script can't continue..." -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host
break

}
4. CompliancePolicy_Remove.ps1
This script gets all the Compliance policies from the Intune Service that you have authenticated with, then:

Prompts the administrator to specify a policy to delete by policy ID.
Removes/deletes the policy from the service
